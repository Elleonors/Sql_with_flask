# Setting Up a Flask Application with MySQL on Linux (Arch)

Hey there, I'm about to take you on a wild ride through the world of setting up a Flask application with MySQL on your Arch Linux machine. Buckle up, because it's going to be fun, informative, and a little bit zany!

## Step 1: Installing MySQL on Linux (Arch)

First things first, we need to install MySQL on our Arch Linux machine. Open up your terminal and enter the following command to get MySQL installed:

```
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S mysql
```

Once you've done that, let's make sure the installation went smoothly. Verify the installation by checking the MySQL version with this command:

```
mysql --version
```

### Step 2: Starting MySQL Service

Now that we've got MySQL installed, we need to start the MySQL service. This is crucial because, without it, our database won't be up and running. So, let's enable and start the MySQL service with these commands:

```
sudo systemctl enable mysqld
sudo systemctl start mysqld
```

### Step 3: Securing MySQL Installation (Optional, but Recommended)

For those of you who like to play it safe (and who doesn't?), it's a good idea to secure your MySQL installation. Run the following command to start the secure installation script:

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow the prompts to set a root password and secure your installation. It's like locking your front door before going to bedâ€”just makes sense!

### Step 4: Logging into MySQL

Time to dive into MySQL itself! Log in to the MySQL command line with the root user by using the command below. You'll be prompted to enter the root password you just set.

```
mysql -u root -p
```

## Step 5: Creating a Database

Now that we're inside MySQL, let's create a new database for our Flask application. We'll call it flask_data:

```
CREATE DATABASE flask_data;
```

### Step 6: Creating a User and Granting Privileges (Optional)

If you want to create a new user specifically for this database (a good practice for security), you can do that too. Replace username and password with your desired values:

```
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON flask_data.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Step 7: Verifying the Database Creation

Let's make sure our database was created successfully. Run the following command to see a list of all databases:

```
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### Step 8: Using the Database

Now, let's switch to using our newly created database:

```
USE flask_data;
```

## Step 9: Creating the Table for Submissions

Next, we need a table to store our submissions. Here's a fancy SQL command to create a submissions table with all the necessary fields:

```
CREATE TABLE submissions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    gender ENUM('M', 'F') NOT NULL,
    subjects TEXT,
    submission_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Step 10: Exiting MySQL

Once everything is set up, let's exit the MySQL command line:

```
EXIT;
```

### Step 11: Setting Up the Python App

Now, onto the Python side of things! We need to install the necessary dependencies for our Flask app. Make sure you have a dependencies.txt file with all your required packages, and then run:

```
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

## Step 12: Inserting Your DB Credentials

Modify the app.py file to include your database credentials. Here's a snippet of what that should look like (replace DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD with your MySQL username and password, respectively):

```
# MySQL configuration
db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="DB_USERNAME", # Replace with your MySQL username
    password="DB_PASSWORD", # Replace with your MySQL password
    database="flask_data" # Replace with your MySQL database name
)
```

### Step 13: Running the App

It's showtime! Run your Flask app with the following command:

```
python app.py
```

Then, open your web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see your app in action!

## Step 14: Verifying Your Data

Finally, let's verify that the data you submit through your Flask app is being stored in your MySQL database. Log back into MySQL with your username and database:

```
mysql -u username -p flask_data
```

Then, run the following command to see the data in your submissions table:

```
SELECT * FROM submissions;
``` 

And there you have it! If everything went according to plan, your data should be right there, sitting pretty in your database. Congratulations on setting up your Flask application with MySQL on Arch Linux! Until next time, keep coding and stay curious!
